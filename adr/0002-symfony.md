# 2. Symfony

Date: 2024-08-27

___

## Status

Accepted

___

## Context

We need to choose framework that will be a good skeleton for our application.

___

## Decision

We chose Symfony because it's the most popular PHP framework and is on the market for many years. It also has a big 
community and support. Symfony documentation is clear, easy and complete. https://symfony.com/doc/current/index.html

___

## Consequences

Symfony has a high entry threshold so developers should be familiar with this framework and its components. While 
choosing any framework we have to make sure that it has the lowest possible impact on the rest of the application,
so it should be replaced at any time without big amount of time for rewriting.
